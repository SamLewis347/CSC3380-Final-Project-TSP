Solution for the first part of the 3380 TSP final project.

A path cost calculator: your program will read in an input file of graphs, along with a file
containing cycles and their costs in the graph, and output whether or not the information in
the answer file is valid or not. For clarity, the given path/cycle would only be valid if all vertices
were visited and if we can arrive at the total cost given by, in fact, adding together all the
individual costs between each of the given vertices (and then the cost to return home from
the final vertex).
